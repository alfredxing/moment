## Options
While the options page is pretty straightforwards, here are the customizations you are offered in detail:

### Colour
- **Background colour** controls the colour of the new tab page's background
- **Text colour** controls the colour of the text on the new tab page

### Units
- **Temperature units** allow you to set the units the temperature is displayed in: either degreees Fahrenheit or Celcius.
- **Time format** allows you to choose between a 24-hour clock and a 12-hour clock.

### Formats
- **Time format** allows you to set how your time is displayed. `H` is for hours, `M` for minutes, and `S` for seconds. Make sure to use capital letters!
   - Example: `H:M:S` is displayed as `10:50:53`
- **Date format** is similar to time format: `D` is for the day of the month, `M` is for the month name, and `Y` is for the year.
   - Example: `D M Y` is displayed as `10 July 2013`

### Weather (Firefox only)
- **Location** allows you to set your location. This is completely optional. If you leave this blank, Moment will try to use your IP address to locate approximately where you are.
   - See [this table](http://www.hamweather.com/support/documentation/aeris/supported-places/#content) for a list of supported place formats
  
- *Note for Google Chrome users*: Moment uses HTML5 Geolocation API to find where you are. If you would also like the feature to set your location, feel free to shoot me an email by clicking the "Send Feedback" button on the [extension page](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/moment/nlabgnkjjckboiimmhkeplocmhpcfkkn).
